## grain network philosophy

this software is part of the grain network - a sovereign, temporal-aware system for building next-generation distributed applications.

the grain network is built on principles of:
- local control, global intent
- purpose-built over generic
- declarative over imperative
- template/personal everywhere
- real resources matter
- temporal recursion (now == next + 1)
